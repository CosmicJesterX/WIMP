# 🕵️‍♂️ Weakly Interacting Massive Particles 🌌

**Welcome to WIMP – A project so mysterious, it barely interacts with reality.** 🚀💀

## 🔍 What is WIMP?
Just like its physics counterpart, this project:
- **Exists, but in a way you can’t quite detect.**
- **Interacts weakly, yet has massive implications.**
- **Might be real… or just a mathematical ghost.**

## 🛠️ How does it work?
Well, that depends on whether you can observe it or not. 🤔

### 🚀 Features (or are they?):
- [ ] Self-rendering evolution (maybe?)
- [ ] Quantum-level secrecy 🕳️
- [ ] Private, yet omnipresent
- [ ] If you see it, it might already be too late.

## 📜 Rules of WIMP Club
1. You **do not** talk about WIMP Club.
2. You **do not** talk about WIMP Club.
3. If observed, collapse into a more probable state.
4. Always leave behind a weakly interacting footprint.

## 🛑 Code of Conduct
- **WIMP must not be altered without approval from the master repo or the original author.**
- Any modifications must pass through **strict quantum validation.**
- Unauthorized changes will be considered **anomalous fluctuations** and ignored.
- If you modify WIMP without authorization, it will paradoxically modify you first. 🤯

## 🤫 Contributing (If You Can)
- Fork at your own risk.
- Open a PR only if you understand the implications.
- If you found this, you probably weren’t meant to.

## 💀 Final Thought
If WIMP is private, does it really exist? 🤯

🕶️ **Keep it weak. Keep it massive. Stay quantum.** 🎩🔥
